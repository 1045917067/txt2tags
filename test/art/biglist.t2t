                      =  Lists  =

A list of items is natural, just putting a **dash** or
a **plus** at the beginning of the line.


                  ==  Plain List  ==

The dash is the default list identifier. For sublists,
just add **spaces** at the beginning of the line. More
spaces, more sublists.

  - America
    - South America
      - Brazil
        - How deep can I go?
  - Europe
    - Lots of countries
- Mars
  - Who knows?


The list ends with **two** consecutive blank lines.


                 ==  Numbered List  ==

The same rules as the plain list, just a different
identifier (plus).

+ one
+ two
+ three
  - mixed lists!
  - what a mess
    + counting again
    + ...
+ four


                ==  Definition List  ==

The definition list identifier is a colon, followed by
the term. The term contents is placed on the next line.

: orange
  a yellow fruit
: apple
  a green or red fruit
: other fruits
  - wee!
  - mixing lists
    + again!
    + and again!
